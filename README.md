# anvil

**AI agent package with a pluggable workflow system** — built on top of [Pi Coding Agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) and [Sandcastle](https://github.com/ai-hero-ai/sandcastle).

> Import `anvil` into your project to add AI agent workflows, session management, and transcript generation to your codebase.

## Features

- **Interactive workflow selector** — choose from available agent workflows at startup
- **Workflow system** — extensible registry of agent workflows with configurable skill loading
- **Session management** — automatic session tracking and transcript generation
- **Dockerized environment** — pre-configured Sandcastle image with all dependencies
- **Skill packs** — auto-clones and installs skills from [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills)

## Installation

Add `anvil` to your project:

```bash
bun add anvil
```

Then run the CLI directly from your project root:

```bash
bunx anvil
```

## Usage

```
anvil                  Interactive workflow selector (prompts for selection)
anvil run <workflow>   Run a specific workflow
anvil init             Initialize project (config, skills, Docker image)
anvil transcript       Generate transcripts from session files
anvil help             Show help message
```

### Workflows

| ID | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `interactive` | Interactive | Full Pi terminal UI with editor and chat |
| `init` | Init | 4-step initialization process to define your project |

### Initialization Workflow

The `init` workflow guides you through a structured, multi-step initialization process that creates markdown files to define what your project is about. Each step produces a file in `docs/`, and the workflow automatically detects which step you're on by checking which files already exist.

```bash
# Run the initialization workflow
anvil run init
```

Run `anvil run init` repeatedly — it always picks up where you left off.

#### Step Flow

| Step | Skill | Purpose | Output |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| **1** | `1-init-grill` | YC Office Hours interrogation — nail down the core idea, problem, user, and wedge | `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` |
| **2** | `2-prd` | Turn the validated brief into a structured PRD with features, user stories, scope, and success metrics | `docs/PRD.md` |
| **3** | `3-architecture` | Comprehensive architecture design — system, data, API, security, infra, frontend, backend, performance, scalability, reliability, testing, integrations, observability | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| **4** | `4-bootstrap` | Read the architecture and plan the first implementation issues — repository structure, tooling, CI, dev environment, and scaffold (final step) | `docs/BOOTSTRAP_PLAN.md` |

### Examples

```bash
# Interactive mode — select a workflow
anvil

# Run the interactive workflow directly
anvil run interactive

# Run the initialization workflow
anvil run init

# Initialize a new project
anvil init

# Generate transcripts from recorded sessions
anvil transcript
```

## Configuration

Run `anvil init` to create an `anvil.json` config file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldsp91/anvil/main/anvil.schema.json",
  "maxIterations": 5,
  "models": {
    "init": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "placeholder": "gpt-4"
  }
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `maxIterations` | `integer` | Maximum number of agent iterations (min: 1) |
| `models` | `object` | Per-workflow model overrides (see below) |

### Per-Workflow Model Configuration

You can configure different models for each workflow (except `interactive`, which uses whatever model you select in-session). The `models` object maps workflow IDs to model names:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldsp91/anvil/main/anvil.schema.json",
  "maxIterations": 5,
  "models": {
    "init": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "placeholder": "gpt-4"
  }
}
```

**Note:** The `interactive` workflow is excluded from per-workflow model configuration because it uses whatever model you select in-session via the Pi terminal UI.

**Available model names:** Use the model ID as defined in the Pi AI model registry (e.g., `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gpt-4`, `claude-opus-4-5`). You can find available models by running `pi` and checking the model selector.

## Docker / Sandcastle

The `Dockerfile` creates a Sandcastle-compatible image with:

- **Node 25** + **Bun** + **uv** (Python toolchain)
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`)
- **Chromium** (for browser automation)
- **Pi Coding Agent** (global install)
- Custom `pi-headroom` and `pi-vent` plugins

### Building

```bash
anvil init
```

This builds a Docker image tagged `sandcastle:<project-name>` from the Dockerfile.

### Running

Sandcastle bind-mounts your project at `/home/agent/workspace` inside the container. The entrypoint is `sleep infinity`, so you connect via `docker exec` or Sandcastle's sandbox mode.

## Adding Workflows

Workflows are defined in `bin/workflows/` and registered in `bin/workflows/registry.ts`:

```typescript
import { Workflow } from "./types.js";

export const myWorkflow: Workflow = {
  id: "my-workflow",
  name: "My Workflow",
  description: "What it does",
  skills: ["engineering/to-prd"],  // optional skill packs
  async run(prompt, options) {
    // Your agent session logic here
  },
};
```

Then add it to the `workflows` array in `registry.ts`.
